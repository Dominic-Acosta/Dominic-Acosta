## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m Dominic, a dedicated student majoring in Computer Science and Cybersecurity & Forensics, with a strong passion for designing and analyzing secure systems. I enjoy working across both frontend and backend development, creating applications that are efficient, scalable, and security-focused. I specialize in backend server-side development, API development, and performance optimization, while ensuring seamless collaboration with frontend teams.

I also specialize in digital forensics, where I investigate and analyze digital evidence to ensure data integrity and uncover valuable insights in the context of cybersecurity.
